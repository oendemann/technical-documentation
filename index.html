          <p>On many systems Python comes pre-installed, you can try running the python command to start the Python interpreter to check and see if it is already installed. On windows you can try the py command which is a launcher which is more likely to work. If it is installed you will see a response which will include the version number, for example:</p>
          <p class="example">Python 3.9.6 (tags/v3.9.6:db3ff76, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
If you don't see this, you will need to install Python on your system.</p>
          <p>If the version number is Python 2.x.y (where x and y are any number) you are using Python 2 which is no longer supported and is not a good choice for development. You can try running python3 to see if there is also a Python 3.x.y version installed, if not you'll want to install the latest version of Python. </p>
          <p> If you do not have Python installed or need a newer version you can go to:</p>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </header>
        <section class="body-section">
          <p>Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.</p>
          <p>Some of Python's notable features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.</li>
            <li>Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.</li>
            <li>Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.
</li>
            <li>Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.</li>
            <li>Is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.</li>
            <li>Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.</li>
            <li class="link-list">Runs anywhere, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/">Mac OS X</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Windows</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html">Linux</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html">Unix</a>, with unofficial builds also available for Android and iOS.</li>
            <li class="link-list">Is free software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in your application. Python can also be freely modified and re-distributed because while the language is copyrighted it's available under an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/license.html">open-source license</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some programming-language features of Python are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.</li>
            <li>Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritances.</li>
            <li>Code can be grouped into modules and packages.</li>
            <li>The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.</li>
            <li>Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised, so errors are caught sooner.</li>
            <li>Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.</li>
            <li>Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Common Syntax Errors</h2>
        </header>
        <section class="body-section">
          <h3>Misplaced, missing, or mismatched punctuation</h3>
          <p><span class="numbered-bullet">1. </span>Ensure that parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {} are properly closed. When left unclosed, the Python interpreter treats everything following the first parenthesis, bracket, or brace as a single statement. Take a look at this web scraping code sample that sends parsing instructions to our web scraping tool:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
payload = {
    "source": "universal",
    "url": "https://sandbox.oxylabs.io/products/1",
    "parse": True,
    "parsing_instructions": {
        "title": {
            "_fns": [
                {
                    "_fn": "css_one",
                    "_args": ["h2"]
                }
            ]
        }
    }

# Error message
  File "&ltstdin&gt", line 1
    payload = {
              ^
SyntaxError: '{' was never closed
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="below-code">At first glance, it may look like the payload was closed with braces, but the Python interpreter raises a syntax error that says otherwise. You can fix the error by closing the payload:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
payload = {
    "source": "universal",
    "url": "https://sandbox.oxylabs.io/products/1",
    "parse": True,
    "parsing_instructions": {
        "title": {
            "_fns": [
                {
                    "_fn": "css_one",
                    "_args": ["h2"]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
} # Add the missing brace
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="below-code"><span class="numbered-bullet">2. </span>Make sure you close a string with proper quotes. For example, if you started your string with a single quote ‘, then use a single quote again at the end of your string. The below code snippet illustrates this:</p>
          <p>This example has two errors, but as you can see, the interpreter shows only the first syntax error. It pinpoints the issue precisely, which is the use of a single quote at the start, and a double quote at the end to close the string.</p>
          <p>The second error is in the third example URL, which isn’t closed with a quotation mark at all. The syntactically correct version would look like this:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
list_of_URLs = (
    'https://example.com/1',
    'https://example.com/2',
    'https://example.com/3'
)
print(list_of_URLs)
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="below-code">When the string content itself contains quotation marks, use single ‘, double “, and/or triple ‘’’ quotes to specify where the string starts and ends. For instance:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
print("In this example, there's a "quote within 'a quote'", which we separate with double and single quotes.")

# Error message
  File "&ltstdin&gt", line 1
    print("In this example, there's a "quote within 'a quote'", which we separate with double and single quotes.")
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="below-code">The interpreter shows where the error occurred, and you can see that the carets end within the second double quotation mark. To fix the syntax error, you can wrap the whole string in triple quotes (either ’’’ or “””):</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
print("""In this example, there's a "quote within 'a quote'", which we specify with double and single quotes.""")
            </code>
